# Level Up with Object Oriented Programming in Java!

This repository contains the exercises and demos we'll work through as part of this course!

**This repository should be complete and ready at least 3 weeks before class start!  It's still in progress at the moment!**

Here's what you should do before the course starts (if you plan to follow along with the exercises only):

## Get Java working

This course requires Java 8 or higher to follow along or run the code examples offline before or after the course.

First, check to see if you have an appropriate version of Java already installed and accesssible.  Open up your terminal (Mac or Linux) or command prompot (windows) and type "java -version", like so:

```
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.7" 2020-04-14
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.7+10)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.7+10, mixed mode)
```
In this case, we have OpenJDK 11, and we'd be good to go.

If you don't have Java installed, try these links.  Either Oracle JDK or Open JDK is fine.

* [OpenJdk](https://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html)
* [Oracle Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html)

It's possible you may also need to set the Java Home environment variable:

* [Setting Java Home](https://www.baeldung.com/java-home-on-windows-7-8-10-mac-os-x-linux)

Once this is all setup, you should be abble to go to a command prompt, as shown above, and get "java -version" to respond appropriately.
